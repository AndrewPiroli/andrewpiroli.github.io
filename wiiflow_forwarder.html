            <h1>Installing/Autobooting Wiiflow via Priiloader</h1>
        </header>
        <p>WiiFlow is weird, it does not like to be directly launched by Priiloader.<br>
            So you need to use a "forwarder dol" to load, which will then load the real thing.<br>
            You can find the forwarder dol <a href="assets/static/apps_wiiflow_boot.dol">here</a><br>
            Rename it to 'boot.dol', create a new folder in your 'apps' folder alongside your other homebrew, name it 'wiiflow_forwarder' and place the file you downloaded above in there.<br>
            Now when you enter Priiloader, go to Load/Install File and select 'wiiflow_forwarder', it will now be installed and available to be used in launching from Priiloader or autobooting.<br>
            The forwarder tries to load the path sd:/apps/wiiflow/boot.dol, if that's not there, it will try to load the same path from USB, the folder name <b>MUST</b> exactly match.<br><br>
            <b>DO NOT ASK FOR SUPPORT FOR THIS FORWARDER UNLESS YOU HAVE VERIFIED EVER STEP ABOVE, I WILL BE VERY UPSET</b>
